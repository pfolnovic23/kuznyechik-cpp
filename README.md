# Kuznyechik (GOST R 34.12-2015) C++ Implementation

This project provides a C++ implementation of the Russian block cipher **Kuznyechik**, also known as "Grasshopper", as specified in the GOST R 34.12-2015 standard. It was developed as part of a seminar paper for the *Data Structures and Algorithms* course at the Faculty of Organization and Informatics, University of Zagreb.

## 🔐 About the Algorithm
Kuznyechik is a modern symmetric block cipher that features:
- 128-bit data blocks
- 256-bit keys
- 10 rounds of SPN (Substitution-Permutation Network)
- S-box substitution, R/L-transformations, and key mixing

For mathematical details and structure, refer to the documentation.
